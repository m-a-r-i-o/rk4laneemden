#This script solves the Lane-Emden equation numerically. The equation is a toy model of a star.
#The solution is returned in terms of ascii output with headers. First column is radius in meters.
#Second column is density in kg/m^3. Third column is pressure in Pascal. Internal (dimensionless)
#quantities are used in the computation. Fourth column is dimensionless radius, usually known as xi.
#Fifth colum is the dimensionless quantity theta. Sixt column its derivative wrt dimensionless radius.
#Run using ./rk4_laneemden.py > lane. The file "lane" can be read using read.table() in R, for example.
#the script will run in a linux or mac-os system with python installed in /usr/bin/python.
#If you cannot run it check that it is executable. chmod u+x rk4_laneemden.py will make it executable.
#Read more about the equation at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laneâ€“Emden_equation
#This script uses the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to solve the equation numerically.
#I know that there are better algorithms around, this was written to show RK4 to computational astronomy
#students. It may not be optimal but it was written together with the students in an application
#of the socratic method of teaching (maieutics) and was only minimally edited afterwards.

#Thinking points:
#Solving an ordinary differential equation is possible if we provide initial conditions.
#This is true both for analytic solutions and for numeric solutions. This is a second order equation, so
#we need to provide both an initial value for the function and an initial value for its derivative.
#The equation does not "know" anything about the physics of the problem. It may happen that the dimensionless
#variable theta becomes negative for some radius, which would mean that the density is negative. This
#is physically unacceptable but the program does not know it. We have to realize it for ourselves.
#If we want our "star" to be similar to the sun we can set the proportionality constant K in the polytropic
#equation of state and the central density so that both density and pressure are the same as those in the
#center of the sun. But how do we know these, except from Wolfram alpha or a book? Shouldn't we use the
#surface density and pressure instead? The most straightforward way to provide initial conditions for an
#equation may not be the best from the operational point of view!
#What about the equation of state of ideal gases? Why can we use this polytropic equation instead?
#Is the Sun a perfect gas? (spoiler: no, it has a different equation of state because of radiation)
#Does this equation describe the correct physics of energy generation in the sun? (no...)
#If not, why does it (kind-of) work?
